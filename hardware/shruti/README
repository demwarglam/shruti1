Name: Shruti-1
Type: Compact table-top synth
Audio I/O: 6.35 Jack (Mono audio out), 6.35 Jack (External signal in)
MIDI: in, out (thru + patch dumps)
Controllers: 12 facade LEDs, 2x16 LCD display, 4 pots for patch editing. 2
assignable pots, 2 CV input for performance controllers. Volume and mixer pot. 5 navigation switches, one inc/dec pair.


Monophonic synth section:

Hybrid digital / analog synthesis.

* 2 sync'able, x-modable DCOs:
- pulse, square (with pulse-width modulation), triangle with waveshapping, sawtooth. All band-limited (sort of).
- sawtooth with sweepable resonance.
- simplistic FM (1>2 configuration, adjustable modulation index and frequency ratio).
- low-fi vowel synthesis (think "speak and spell").
- cheap 8bit waveforms with plenty of aliasing.
- 32 waveforms sweepable wavetable.
- "sweep" oscillator which scans through all the waveforms (think wave table
  scan, when controlled by a LFO or Envelope, or wave sequence).
* Noise & sub-oscillator (triangle or square).
* 2 LFO (square, wave, triangle, sample & hold).
* 2 ADSR envelopes.
* 14 patchcords modulation matrix (16 modulation sources, 11 destinations).
* That curtis VCF/VCA (with external input).
* Arpeggiator with 6 different patterns + direction and octave setting.
* 16-steps step sequencer.
* 16-patches patch memory.
* Support for (some) indian/arabic scales.


TODO:

Polyphonic expander section:
 
"Crappo" wavetable synthesizer (think "annoying polyphonic ringtone").
 
In case people wanted to compose entire songs with the module and nothing else,
this uber-cheap section can handle the task. Yes, those are the same sounds
that polyphonic ringtones - As an apology, you can route them to the filters.
