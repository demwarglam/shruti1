Name: Shruti-1
Type: Compact table-top synth
Audio I/O: 6.35 Jack (Mono audio out), 6.35 Jack (External signal in)
MIDI: in, out (thru + patch dumps)
Controllers: 11 facade LEDs, 2x16 LCD display, 4 pots for patch editing. 2
assignable pots, 1 ribbon controller. Volume and mixer pot.


Monophonic synth section:

Hybrid retro-digital (8 bits) / analog synthesis.

* 2 sync'able VCOs:
- pulse, square (with pulse-width modulation), triangle, sawtooth. All band-limited (sort of).
- sawtooth with sweepable resonance.
- simplistic FM (1 parameter).
- low-fi speech synthesis (think "speak and spell").
- cheap 8bit waveforms with plenty of aliasing.
- 32 waveforms sweepable wavetable.
- "sweep" oscillator which scans through all the waveforms (think wave table
  scan, when controlled by a LFO or Envelope, or wave sequence).
* Noise source & sub-oscillator (triangle or square).
* 2 LFO (square, wave, triangle, sample & hold).
* 2 ADSR envelopes.
* Assignable modulation matrix.
* Curtis filters (analog! external signals welcome!).
* Arpeggiator with 6 different patterns.
* 16-steps step sequencer.
* 16-patches patch memory.


TODO:

Polyphonic expander section:
 
"Crappo" wavetable synthesizer (think "annoying polyphonic ringtone").
 
In case people wanted to compose entire songs with the module and nothing else,
this uber-cheap section can handle the task. Yes, those are the same sounds
that polyphonic ringtones - As an apology, you can route them to the filters.
