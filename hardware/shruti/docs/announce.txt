Monophonic synth section:

Hybrid retro-digital (8 bits) / analog synthesis.

* 2 sync'able VCOs:
- pulse, square (with pulse-width modulation), triangle, sawtooth. All band-limited (sort of).
- phase distortion.
- easy to use FM (1 parameter).
- low-fi speech synthesis (think "speak and spell").
- cheap 8bit waveforms with plenty of aliasing.
- "sweep" oscillator which scans through all the waveforms (think wave table scan, when controlled by a LFO or Envelope, or wave sequence).
* Noise source & sub-oscillator (triangle or square).
* 2 LFO (square, wave, triangle, sample & hold).
* ADSR envelope.
* Assignable modulation matrix.
* Curtis filters (analog! external signals welcome!).
* Arpeggiator.
* 16-steps step sequencer.


Polyphonic expander section:

"Crappo" wavetable (think "annoying polyphonic ringtone").

In case people wanted to compose entire songs with the module, I added this uber-cheap section I am ashamed to speak of.
As an apology, Crappo can be routed through a fuzz/distortion module and the analog filter.
